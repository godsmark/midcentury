Exercise 1A for Metis coursework

We had to design and implement a single page blog in HTML & CSS with the following constraints. 
The client required a header, footer, and body with the following content:

* Header
  * Page Title ("Midcentury Therapy")
* Body
  * Posts
  * Post Title
  * Post Content
  * Post Date
  * Sidebar
    * Blurb about the blog ("Hello! Welcome to Midcentury Therpy, a blog run by Midcentury Envy in NYC. This is where we share our best midcentury finds and home decor tips.")
* Footer
  * Copyright ("Â© Midcentury Envy, LLC")

The client also researched other blogs and suggested the following elements 

* Tagline ("Saving the world, one room at a time")
* Post - Time
* Post - Author
* Post - Category
* Post - Tags
* Post - Related Posts
* Calendar for jumping to posts from a specific date
* List of featured posts
* List of recent posts
* List of posts by month
* List of categories
* List of tags
* Email (hello@midcenturytherapy.com)
* Address (Midcentury Envy, 670 Broadway, New York, NY 10012)

The objective of this project was to take the list of suggested elements and figure out what was most important, less important, and which could be discarded.
